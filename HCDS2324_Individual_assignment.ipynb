You can find the dataset and a description of the variables here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/top-spotify-songs-2023\n","\n","The dataset is also available to download from Brightspace. If you download it from Kaggle, note that the value in `df.loc[576, 'streams']` (cell I576 if you open it in Excel) is not a number so you need to deal with that in some way or you'll get errors when fitting the model. I've replaced it with a random number in the version on Brightspace.\n","\n","Through the Kaggle link above, you can also find Python notebooks by other people that have analyzed the dataset! Feel free to go through them to get inspired, but remember that you should only hand in your own work. If you use large parts of code from an existing notebook, you have to put a comment above the code with a link to where you found it.\n","\n","## The data\n","\n","* The datafile `spotify-2023.csv` has 24 columns and 953 rows;\n","* For the variable descriptions, check the Kaggle link;\n","* The variable that you need to predict is `streams`. Note that we are predicting the number of streams, so this is a regression task!\n","\n","## Compulsory elements of the task\n","\n","1. [2 points] Load the dataset into a `pandas` dataframe, have a look at the first few lines. Briefly describe each column and the target variable. Are they numerical or categorical? What are the measurement units?\n","2. [2 points] The goal of the assignment is to make a prediction model.  Explain which variables you want to use, as well as which prediction model(s), and why.\n","3. [2 points] Show basic descriptives (mean, proportion, distribution, range, etc) of the variables that you plan to use in your prediction model, either numerically, graphically or a combination of the two.\n","4. [1 point] Clean the data, making sure data types are correct for each column. Convert categorical variables to dummy variables, check for and deal with missing data, etc.\n","5. [1 point] Create at least one additional column to use in your model.\n","6. [2 points] Use `.groupby()` or `.pivot_table()` in combination with row filtering at least once to demonstrate something related to your analysis.\n","7. [1 point] Split your data into a train and test set in a sensible way, and explain this split.  \n","8. [1 point] Train your model and predict the target value for the test set.\n","9. [3 points] Evaluate your results using relevant metrics to check the quality of your predictions. Investigate feature importances and whether they seem sensible to you.\n","10. [3 points] Write a conclusion: do you think you succeeded in building a good prediction model? Where could you improve? If you tried something that didn't work, why do you think it didn't work? Did you get the results you expected?\n","\n","\n","**Sum: 18 points. Partial points can be obtained for each element. Your grade will be equal to `1 + points/2`.**\n","\n","Use your creativity and any method you'd like to try to achieve the best possible score for your prediction model. You can even use deep learning if you feel comfortable with that! Bonus points can be awarded for creativity.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"wC5Ph_DUk1Wt"},"source":["## Getting started\n","\n","To help you get started with this regression analysis, I've done a simple linear regression model on this dataset and evaluated it.
